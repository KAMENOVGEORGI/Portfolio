The bandits are closing in, and the forest is your only chance to escape. But beware... not all who enter         this forest leave unscathed.",

Echoes of unseen movements bounce off the jagged walls, and the faint glow of bioluminescent fungi casts eerie           shadows. They say those who enter this cave lose more than their way. Legends speak of spirits that guard                treasures and devour trespassers. Do you dare to proceed?",

Some say the ruins are haunted by the restless spirits of those who                perished defending its walls. Others believe treasures lie hidden within, guarded by ancient traps and curses.           The only certainty is that those who enter rarely return. Will you be the exception?",

But as night falls,         the sands grow cold, and the wind carries the mournful cries of those who vanished without a trace. Stories of a          hidden temple buried beneath the sands are as numerous as tales of those who sought it and disappeared. Do you           have what it takes to survive the desertâ€™s trials?",
        5: "The final trial awaits. The mountainâ€™s peak pierces the heavens, and the path to it is treacherous. They say          the air here is thick with the weight of forgotten battles, and the snow hides secrets best left undisturbed. At         the summit lies your destinyâ€”or your doom.
