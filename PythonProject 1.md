# ðŸŒ² Shadowed Realms: A Text-Based Python Adventure ðŸŒ²

**Shadowed Realms** is a thrilling text-based adventure game where every decision matters. Traverse through mysterious lands, solve challenging riddles, and make daring choices to survive.

> My goal for this project is to develop fully this code and place it with a 5D VR gameplay. What you will see now is a small taste of how the game will look like and how the gameplay will be.
> Enjoy ðŸ–¤
